# Basic_Face_Detection

This is a real-time Face Detection project using OpenCV and a Haar Cascade Classifier. It captures video from your webcam, processes each frame to detect human faces, and highlights them with green rectangles. The detection is based on grayscale image processing for better performance and efficiency. This beginner-friendly project demonstrates the basics of computer vision and how to apply pre-trained models for face recognition tasks.
